    "## Hypothesis Testing:\n",
    "- Definition: Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about a population based on sample data.\n",
    "- Purpose: It helps determine whether there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis in favor of an alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "## Steps:\n",
    "- Formulate hypotheses: Null hypothesis (H0) assumes no effect or no difference, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) assumes an effect or difference.\n",
    "- Select a significance level (α): This represents the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true.\n",
    "- Collect and analyze data: Use sample data to compute a test statistic.\n",
    "- Make a decision: Compare the test statistic to a critical value or p-value to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- Draw conclusions: Based on the decision, either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis and interpret the results accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### In hypothesis testing, the p-value represents the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one actually observed under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. In other words, it indicates the probability of obtaining the observed data if the null hypothesis is correct.\n",
    "#### The significance of the p-value lies in its role in decision-making during hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing with significance level (α): Typically, a significance level (α) is chosen before conducting the test. Common values for α are 0.05 or 0.01. If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (p ≤ α), then we reject the null hypothesis. This implies that the observed data is considered statistically significant, suggesting that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interpretation:\n",
    "If the p-value is very small (e.g., p < 0.05), it suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis, indicating that the observed effect is unlikely to be due to random chance alone.\n",
    "If the p-value is larger than the chosen significance level (e.g., p > 0.05), it suggests that the observed effect could plausibly occur due to random variability, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision-making:\n",
    "When the p-value is less than the significance level, we typically reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, concluding that there is sufficient evidence to support the claim or hypothesis being tested.\n",
    "When the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "### T-Test:\n",
    "- Purpose: Used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. Types: Independent t-test (for comparing means of two independent groups) and paired t-test (for comparing means of two related groups).\n"

    "\n",
    "The Chi-Square Test determines if there's a significant association between categorical variables by comparing observed and expected frequencies. It assesses whether the observed distribution differs from what would be expected by chance alone. Calculating a test statistic, typically Chi-Square (χ²), and comparing it to critical values or obtaining a p-value helps make the decision. If the statistic exceeds critical values or has a p-value below a chosen significance level (e.g., α = 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected, suggesting a significant association. Otherwise, the null hypothesis is not rejected, indicating no significant association.\n",
