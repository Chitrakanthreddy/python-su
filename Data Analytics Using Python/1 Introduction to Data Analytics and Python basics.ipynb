    "**Goal:** Summarize historical data to understand trends and patterns.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",

    "> A retail company analyzes last year’s sales data to find out:\n",

    "> * Top 10 selling products\n",

    "**Tools used:** Excel, SQL, Tableau, basic Python (e.g., `pandas.describe()`)\n",

    "> * Stockout reports show inventory shortages\n",
    "> * Campaign data shows reduced marketing spend\n",
